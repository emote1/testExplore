# Reef Web3 History - Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the project's structure, architecture, and data flow. It is intended to be a guide for developers working on this codebase.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project follows a standard feature-based structure for React applications. Here are the key directories and their responsibilities:

## ðŸŒŠ Data Flow

The application's data flow is designed to be unidirectional and reactive, centered around Apollo Client and custom hooks.

1.  **Initiation**: The process starts in `TransactionHistoryWithBlocks.tsx`, which is the primary component responsible for displaying transaction history.

2.  **Data Fetching**: It calls the `use-transaction-data-with-blocks.ts` hook. This hook uses Apollo Client's `useQuery` to execute the `PAGINATED_TRANSFERS_QUERY` against the Subsquid GraphQL API. It also integrates the `usePaginationAndSorting` hook to manage the table's state (current page, page size, sorting order).

3.  **Real-time Updates**: In parallel, the `useTransferSubscription.ts` hook establishes a GraphQL subscription. When a new transaction occurs, the subscription pushes the new data to the client, which is then used to update the Apollo Client cache via `cache-manager.ts`.

4.  **Data Transformation**: The raw data from both the initial query and the subscription is processed by the `mapTransfersToUiTransfers` function in `transfer-mapper.ts`. This crucial step transforms the complex, nested GraphQL data into a flattened, UI-friendly `UiTransfer` object. This is also where the transaction **fee** is extracted by parsing the `TransactionFeePaid` event from the extrinsic's event list.

5.  **Table Adaptation**: The resulting array of `UiTransfer` objects is passed to the `useTanstackTransactionAdapter.ts` hook. This hook prepares the final `table` object required by TanStack Table, bundling the data, columns, and state management logic together.

6.  **Rendering**: The `table` object is passed to the `TransactionTableWithTanStack.tsx` component, which handles the rendering of the table rows and cells.

7.  **Column Definition**: The appearance and behavior of each column are defined in `transaction-columns.tsx`. This file specifies how to render data for each cell, leveraging helper functions from `formatters.ts` to display addresses, amounts, and dates in a readable format.
